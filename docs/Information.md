* [SDK architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/cli-msbuild-architecture)
* Introduction to donet CLI basic commands and new SDK architecture based on msbuild targets 
    * `dotnet --info`
    * `dotnet --version`
    * `dotnet new`
    * `dotnet restore`
    * `dotnet run`

## Understanding the new Project.csproj
* [NuGet is now fully integrated into MSBuild](http://blog.nuget.org/20170316/NuGet-now-fully-integrated-into-MSBuild.html)
* [NuGet pack and restore as MSBuild targets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/msbuild-targets)
* [Packages, Metapackages and Frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/packages)
* [Csproj props](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/project-json-to-csproj)
* `dotnet restore` and the autogenerated `project.assets.json` file.
* Manual trimming of the autogenerated dependency tree.
* Expanding the csproj file with `dotnet msbuild /pp:fullproject.xml`
* Understanding and modifying the SDK props and targets.

## Creating the VotingApp library using TDD
* Basic tips and tricks for using VSCode
    * [VSCode Windows Shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf)
    * [VSCode Mac Shortcust](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf)
* Use integrated terminal for running dotnet cli commands.
* Create xunit project
* Install and understand how the C# extension (aka as [Omnisharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) project) works.
* Run and debug unit tests.
* Extend the dotnet cli tooling. 
    *  [DotNetTools](https://github.com/aspnet/DotNetTools) for live testing with `donet watch test`
* Create classlib project.
* Map the dotnet cli commands to your keyboard thanks to VSCode and `tasks.json`
* Use a [sln](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-sln) file for better project management.

## Creating the VotingApp Console Client (Windows machine required)
* Use the debugger and understand the `launch.json` file.
* [Target .net core and .net framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks)
* [Introducing .net standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library)
    *   Reference assemblies
    *   Implementation assemblies
    *   Facade assemblies (aka [type forwarding](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/davbr/2009/09/30/type-forwarding/))  
*  Target different frameworks in the context of the votinapp for better understanding of netstandard.
* [netstandard analogy](https://github.com/paulopez78/dotnet-target-frameworks)

## Publishing the VotingApp Console in different frameworks and runtimes
*   [Portable vs Self contained deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/index)
*   [Runtime identifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog)
*   [.NET Core native prerequisites](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md)
*   Use windows, macosx and docker (for linux runtime) for testing different published outputs.

## Creating the ASP.NET Core VotingApp.Api  
* [Swagger](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)
*  Use the debugger and understand the `launch.json` file.
*  Using [static files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/static-files) for building the UI.
*  Using websockets for realtime voting.

## Upgrading the VotingApp.Api to .NET Core 2.0 Preview 1
*   What's new?
*   Pinning your SDK with `global.json` file
*   New netcoreapp2.0 and netstandard2.0 packages
    *   Introducing `netstandard.dll` reference assembly
    *   Reuse existing .net framework libs thanks to the `mscorlib.dll` facade assembly
*   [New ASP .NET Core All package and the storage folder](https://andrewlock.net/the-microsoft-aspnetcore-all-metapackage-is-huge-and-thats-awesome-thanks-to-the-net-core-runtime-store-2)
*   [New default builder and default configuration](https://andrewlock.net/exploring-program-and-startup-in-asp-net-core-2-preview1-2/)

## Running the VotingApp with Docker
*   What is a docker container and a docker image
*   Docker basic commands
    * `docker build`
    * `dotnet run`
*   [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
*   Official .NET Core Microsoft Images
